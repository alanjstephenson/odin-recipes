    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these instructions to the letter for a perfect pizza every time!</p>
    <h3><em>Pizza Base</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve the sugar in the warm water in the medium bowl</li>
        <li>Mix the yeast into the water mixture and leave in a warm place for 10 minutes until it activates</li>
        <p><em>You'll know it's ready and active when it looks all frothy on top!</em></p>
        <li>Combine your flour and sugar in the mixing bowl and make a well in the middle</li>
        <li>Once your yeast is activated, pour the olive oil into the flour, followed by the water mixture</li>
        <li>Mix with a wooden spoon until roughy combined and pour onto clean work surface. Scrape the sides of bowl with spatula to ensure all of the mixture is on the bench</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture together eith your hands until it forms a dough</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for 10 minutes to build strength. This is important for when you're stretching it into a base later</li>
        <li>Grease a clean mixing bowl with 1tsp of olive oil and put your dough inside. Cover it with a tea towel and leave in a warm place for 1 hour or until roughly doubled in size</li>
        <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a clean surface</li>
        <li>Split the dough into roughly 2/3 and 1/3 to give you an adult portion and child portion</li>
        <li>Line two trays with baking paper and lightly flour them. Take your portioned dough and squash them down into a patty shape before turning them over, ensuring there is flour underneath once more.</li>
        <li>Push the dough down, stretching it withh your hands into the shape you desire until your pizza base is complete!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Pizza toppings</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Now that your pizza base is ready, make sure your oven is set to 200c, fan oven</li>
        <li>Empty a tin of tomatoes into a container, I use a protein shaker bottle</li>
        <li>Season to your taste with dried oregano and garlic powder then blend, be generous!</li>
        <li>Take 3/4 spoonfuls and put in the centre of your adult pizza, less for the childs portion. Spead it around the base of the pizza using the back of the spoon</li>
        <li>Cover the pizza base with grated cheese and place your pepperoni</li>
        <li>Cook your pizzas for between 12-15 minutes depending on taste then slice and place up!</li>
    </ol>
