This is my first project following along with the Odin Projects teachings. I have learned far more than I need to to follow along exactly with this previously via freecodecamp teachings but I will be following it basically as per the Odin project so as to not intefere with lessons further down the line. 

I will be creating a basic HTML based website without CSS styling containing a home page and multiple recipe pages. 

I will be putting into practice settings up my boilerplate, head tags, body tags including metadata, headings, p's, links and images.

Completing this project should refresh my skills in basic HTML readying me for future lessons and re-establishing my skills using GIT commits and vs code.
